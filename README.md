Assignment 3, In Class
----------------------------------

### Staralt Clone

For this in-class assignment, you will each be responsible for developing small modules that we will tie together.  The goal is to recreate a version of [Staralt](http://catserver.ing.iac.es/staralt), a web app that displays the altitude of a given object as a function of time.  Staralt is a very useful tool that helps observers plan out exposures during the night.

Each module has been geared toward a different skill-level.  Coding elements include: learning to read an API, understanding modules as a 'contract', string parsing, trigonometry, unit conversion, and more.  Additionally, you and your teammates will practice 'pair programming'--a rewarding, yet often frustrating, experience.

------
To begin, you and your group should clone the repository (```git clone git@github.com:MIfA-Computer-Club/HW3.git```).  Then, over the course of the next hour, develop your module.  Test the module by running ```python test.py [file]``` in the ```utils``` directory.  At the end, push the repository back to github (```git commit -am 'I diddled with [file]'; git push```), and we will try out all the modules together.

Please do not work on this ahead of time.  This needs to be a 'live' assignment for us to practice in-class workshops.  If all goes well, we can attempt this model on future projects.

------
The modules have been organized by difficulty.  Please team up with a group of comparable python/coding experience.  Utilize whatever packages/online resources you can find.

File | Difficulty
----- | -----
utils/query_mod.py | ```****```
utils/altaz_mod.py | ```***```
utils/coord_mod.py | ``` ***```
utils/angle_mod.py |  ```**```
utils/time_mod.py  |  ```**```
