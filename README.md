Assignment 3, In Class
----------------------------------

### Staralt Clone

For this in-class assignment, you will each be responsible for developing small modules that we will tie together.  The goal is to recreate a version of [Staralt](http://catserver.ing.iac.es/staralt), a web app that displays the altitude of a given object as a function of time during the night.  Staralt is a very useful tool that helps observers plan out exposures during the night.

Each module has been geared toward a different skill-level.  Coding elements include: learning to read an API, understanding modules as a 'contract', string parsing, trigonometry, unit conversion, and more.  Additionally, you and your teammates will practice 'pair programming'--a rewarding, yet often frustrating, experience.

------
To begin, you and your group should clone the repository.  Then, over the course of the next hour, develop your module.  At the end, push the repository back to github, and we will try out all the modules together.

Please do not work on this ahead of time.  This needs to be a 'live' assignment for us to practice in-class workshops.  If all goes well, we can attempt this model on future projects.
